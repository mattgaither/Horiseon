# Horiseon Challenge

## Description 

I have reworked the index.html and the style.css files to meet accessibility standards. I have give all the div element new element tag names to help structure the page and help the search enginess find the webpage.

I have also added athe alt tag to the images and made the discriptions of the alt tags that added context to the images for screen reader purposes.

I have consolidated some of the css to take up less space and to not have repetition. This makes the page look a lot cleaner.

I have give the page a title for the webpage.

I made sure all the links work on the page and fixed the errors that was sstopping the links from working.

I have made the notes on the sheets so that it is easy to read and so whomever wants to adjust the page to know what I have done.
